**NetCentric Platform**

 

The NetCentric Trading Platform is an Algorithmic, quantitative, automated, decentralized and intelligent crypto currency trading and management system. The NetCentric platform provides trading signals by using historical data back testing verified trading strategies. Once the signal is generated, NetCentric validates the signal and confirms whether it is consistent with the investor’s account settings and preferences. If the signal is accepted, NetCentric sends the trading signal to the investor’s trading robots for execution. 

 

**Risk of Loss**

 

The risk of loss in trading crypto currencies can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. When trading using NetCentric platform, you may sustain losses with the trading robot’s auto execution. Before deciding to subscribe to any trading strategy/robot, you should carefully consider your objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not trade or invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
